# Fibonacci Series using Recursion

This Java program prints the Fibonacci series up to the nth term using recursion.

## Description

The `Recursion.java` program calculates and prints the Fibonacci series up to the nth term using recursion. It takes the input `n` from the user to determine the number of terms in the Fibonacci series. It starts by printing the first two terms of the series (`0` and `1`) and then recursively calculates and prints subsequent terms until reaching the nth term.

## Example
For example, if the user inputs 7 as the number of terms, the program will output:
```
how many terms you want:
7
0 1 1 2 3 5 8
